        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kevin Zhang and I am a sophomore studying at the University of Pittsburgh. I major in Information Science with a minor in Computer Science and Statistics. After transitioning through college without a clear idea of my future, I have recently found my passion in data science and data analytics. As I pursue this career path, I have been looking to add to my current skill set of Java by self-teaching myself Python and SQL. </p> 

        <p>Outside of academics, I have an interest in tennis and basketball. I have played tennis for about six years now and look forward to the change of seasons when I can begin playing again. I have a profound love for Marvel movies and will probably out-do anyone in terms of knowledge about them. I am fluent in Chinese though it might need some brushing up. I am committed to my church and plan on serving in missions this upcoming spring break. </p>
        
        <p>I am originally from Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Though that love isnâ€™t explicit at all times, it is a great city with many things to do. If you ever need suggestions on what to do while in Philly, feel free to ask!</p>
