        <h3>Genre Remix</h3>
          <p>I originally changed my movie poster from a horror movie into a comedy. If I could reimagine my work into another genre, I would’ve chosen to make it into a romance. It likely would have evoked a much different response from the audience. My original poster would likely get a laugh or two due to how shocking and weird it is. But a romance poster wouldn’t have been too comedic. There was already a man and a woman on the poster so I wouldn’t have had to change the dynamic too much. Since it was originally a poster of the woman being afraid of the man, I probably would’ve changed the title to make it have a more romantic theme. I would’ve changed the color to make it less musty and instead more vibrant. I would try to change the font as well to make it more bubbly which gives off a cuter vibe. </p>
        <h3>Website</h3>
          <p>My website is an example of how I used colors, fonts, and more to create an inviting feeling for the user. I picked a melon/pastel green color so that it was calming and easy on the eyes for the user. I didn’t want any jarring colors and anything that could cause the user to click away. The same idea was applied to my font. I chose a font that can be seen anywhere during your regular day. It wasn’t meant to be a font that was memorable but rather an extremely common one. If I could, I would’ve spent more time with the CSS of my website. There are many functions that I see on professional websites that I wish I could incorporate but I lack the knowledge to do so. I would’ve liked to have more user-interactive features on my website instead of simple links. I would’ve changed the menu as well.</p>
        <h3>Expectations</h3>
          <p>This assignment compared one advertisement to another. At this time, my knowledge of Photoshop was not very extensive so I picked an advertisement that I thought could be easily editable. I picked the paintbrush advertisement and noticed how dull it looked. I chose to edit it by adding more color to it and for it to fit the words more. The word “purity” was used so I decided to change the droplets into gold and add a glowing effect to it. With this I wanted the droplets to symbolize something pure and something treasurable. If I could revise it more, I would change the text on the advertisement into something satirical. I would’ve played around with the words and mocked the product instead. I think it would’ve had a greater impact on whoever was viewing it albeit in a negative way. Overall, I would’ve tried to make the advertisement visually more jarring and impactful at first glance. </p>
        <h3>Logo</h3>
          <p>The logo assignment definitely took me the longest out of all of the photoshop assignments. It took many YouTube tutorials and many Google searches to find out how exactly to work with the many features of Photoshop. It was tough following the tutorial and searches because they used older features of Photoshop so some functions were placed differently and I had to figure out through trial and error how the 2020 version of Photoshop worked. Cropping the fruits and foods for this logo assignment was also difficult because I would always get a little bit of white whenever I did. It was frustrating to see that my logo wasn’t completely clean and I didn’t know how to fix it either. In the end, I was able to finish through much trial and error. I persisted through and was able to find a design that I felt okay with at the end.</p>
        <h3>Pecha Kucha</h3>
          <p>My Pecha Kucha stuck out to me because I enjoyed making it and learning about the Interference Effect. As I was finding examples and facts, I found that the Interference Effect was something I never noticed. I enjoyed making the presentation and found myself subjecting to the effect as I practiced presenting. I think I could’ve afforded adding a little more text onto the screen. I think the audience had to acquire the information primarily by listening to my words. I think I would’ve added some words to make it easier for visual learners to learn about the Interference Effect. If possible, I would’ve added more examples as well instead of only one for each sub-category. I think this would’ve made it more interactive for the audience. I also think my delivery could’ve been better. I stumbled on my words often and I could’ve had more information to back up my claim.</p> 
     
        
        <h1>Reflection Essay</h1>
          <p>Coming into the class, I expected this to be a writing course. I expected to be writing essays and doing a lot of readings. I did not expect to be coding with HTML/CSS, editing photos with Photoshop, or editing sounds with Audacity. I did not expect to take much from this course or for this course to really teach me anything new. However, as I did the assignments, I found that my expectations were quickly proved wrong. I had no experience in web design heading into this class. As I worked with html and started coding my website, I found HTML/CSS to be a valuable skill that I can add to my repertoire. The next unit in the class was Photoshop and I found that to be the most frustrating and unenjoyable to work with. I had difficulty incorporating all of the functions that Photoshop had to offer and the work suffered from that. I found that all of my work tended to be quite simple and didn’t demonstrate all that Photoshop was capable of. The last unit of this class had to do with Audacity. My opinions and feelings towards Audacity were neutral. I neither liked it nor hated it. I found the idea of editing sound to be interesting though and both Audacity and Photoshop would be programs that I would revisit in the future. Regardless, web design and working with HTML/CSS was definitely my favorite portion of the class. </p>
          <p>In the beginning of the class, the work consisted of simple writing assignments such as the satirical Amazon review and design concept. Neither of these assignments were difficult to do but it did create a vision for what I wanted my website to look like. Building up my website from scratch was fun to do and definitely made me more interested in the class. I had fun learning how HTML pathing and linking worked and just seeing how my website came to life. The next four assignments consisted of Photoshop. The first assignment involved editing an advertisement. At this point, I had no idea what Photoshop could do so I dipped my feet in and used the paint function and cropping for the most part. I decided to use the word “purity” within the advertisement and painted the droplets gold to make it seem pure. The next assignment was the movie poster genre remix. I was not in class for that day so I had to do this assignment on my own. But I took a horror poster and attempted to turn it into a comedy. The third assignment was the storyboard and I used my Pecha Kucha for this assignment. My Pecha Kucha was on the Interference Effect. I imagined my storyboard to be a video that they would show in a middle school classroom. The fourth assignment for Photoshop was the logo. I spent the most time working on this assignment and the most functions of Photoshop. My imagined company was called Recipreach. The idea was combining the words recipe and preach since the company/app was suggesting recipes for the user to make with their ingredients. </p>
          <p>In terms of revision, I think I tend to revise by taking a look at the big picture and seeing if anything looks off. In terms of the CSS coding, it consisted of a lot of trial and error. I was never certain about the way my website would turn out after coding a line of CSS so I had to try a lot of different things. I think the peer review helped a bit but not as much as I thought it would. But I found looking at my peer’s website to be helpful and helped me understand what I was lacking in my own. The goal was to make sure my website was consistent on every page in terms of alignment, color, and the overall visual impact.</p>
          <p>My target audience was anyone in the population. I intended to make my website simple so that anyone can navigate through it easily. I wanted my website to be one where my work is clearly and easily displayed. The user wouldn’t have to click much to get to my work. Techniques/principles that I used primarily came from Lidwell’s “Universal Principle of Design.” The first principle that I placed an emphasis on was the Aesthetic-Usability Effect which was the phenomenon in which people perceive more-aesthetic designs as easier to use than less-aesthetic design. I definitely had this in mind when planning out my website. I believe that simplistic websites tend to be more aesthetic so I kept my website simple and clean. I also considered the principle of alignment which is the placement of elements such that the edges line up along common rows or columns. Every page in my website is centered in the middle and all of the written portions have the same margin. With these principles in mind, I tried my best to mold my website to include these in hopes that it could satisfy the users’ needs as well.</p>
          <p>After seeing the syllabus for this class and seeing what exactly we would be doing, my goal was to learn as much as I can to apply it to other aspects of my life. Web design was definitely the most applicable to both my major and my career. I found it enjoyable to do and it is something I will revisit in the future for a personal project. Learning Photoshop and Audacity was definitely an experience whether for better or for worse. There were some works I was proud of while I wasn’t for some others. But I’m glad I got to try both programs to see where interest lies. This class definitely set the foundation for me to create something better in the future. I found that many of the techniques and skills that I learned are not only applicable to creating websites. I hope to continue building upon these skills and to incorporate even more aspects to my future website and other projects that I pursue.</p>
