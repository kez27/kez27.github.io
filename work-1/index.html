        <h2>Written Reflection</h2>
        <p>I came into this having had coding experience. I’ve taken a couple CS courses at Pitt so concepts such as nesting were not foreign to me. I have never coded in HTML and CSS before so I was a little nervous coming into the class, but the syntax was easier than I expected. Though there are still many facets to HTML and CSS that I have yet to learn, it is definitely a coding language that is fun to experiment with and to learn. </p>
        
        <p>As I approached this website, I knew it was going to be all trial and error. I had no idea how many pixels to make the margin and I had to search up certain colors in their hexadecimal form. I knew I was going to mess up a lot before my website would even look the way I wanted it to. And to be honest, that is very frustrating. Coding is all about trial and error. Rarely does someone’s program come out perfectly the first time and HTML was no different. Committing on Github was frustrating as well. I would always have to wait a certain amount of time before Github could even tell me that my CSS was incorrect and my website was not looking the way I wanted it to. Through the experiences I had prior to this class and the experiences I had with this class, the idea of iteration was firmly planted in my head.</p>
        
        <p>There are so many things that I wanted to add to the website but I couldn’t get to before this work-in-progress. But I’m not too worried since there is still plenty of time before the end of the semester to add the CSS that I want for my website. There are certain aspects that I included in my design concept that I have yet to finish: the drop down menu, headshot, and color variation. I’m sure as I learn more CSS, there will be more complex functions that I would want to add. However, for now, I’m keeping the simplistic look that I articulated in my design concept.</p>
        
        <p>I didn’t mention this explicitly in my design concept, but I want to make use of the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. I want to make my page as aesthetic as I can so that it appears easier to use and easier to read. I did mention this in my design concept, but I also wanted to make use of the 80/20 Rule. I plan on removing the functions and elements that aren’t important and focusing on optimization of the most crucial functions. In addition, I believe alignment is incredibly important. I aligned my header with my paragraphs and I plan on keeping the alignment the same for each page of the website. I’m still not entirely sure how to implement each of these web design principles effectively, but I would ideally have all of them in some fashion.</p>
        
        <p>As I looked through the calendar, photoshop really stood out to me. I’ve never had any experience in editing photos or videos so I am excited to explore this field. It does seem like a practical skill to have that can be used in both a creative and professional setting. I can see myself using it with my friends too and creating pictures or memes. There was also another section on the calendar labeled data visualization. Although there is not any info at this time, it does sound interesting to me especially since I think I was to do data science in the future. Another activity on the calendar that stood out to me was the soundscape. Again, I never had any experience when it comes to editing and sound isn’t an exception. I think it’d be interesting to learn how to manipulate sound and how to piece certain clips together. Hopefully, these things aren’t too difficult to learn since I would want to use these skills outside of this class.
</p>
        
        <p>In the end, I want to keep my website simplistic and minimalistic, but I also want it to be interactive. I’m still not sure how interactive it can get. Maybe I have to go on many different websites and see how they interact with the user. I don’t think I’m creative enough to make my website stand out. I might have to look upon other big websites to see how they draw users in. I am glad that I got the opportunity to learn HTML and CSS. It is a very frustrating process but very rewarding when you do get it right. As I continue with this class, I’m excited to learn more real-world skills. </p>
