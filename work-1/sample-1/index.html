        <p>Work in Progress 1 begins here</p>
        <p>Gone are the days of wearing one ounce glasses on the top of your nose and walking around all day with that heavy weight on your face. At last, I can fuse my keychain and my glasses into one. So innovative. What levels of intelligence must you reach to come up with this idea? Efficiency and style combined into one product. Never seen it before. It’s just a shame that these glasses only come in one size. I wrote to ThinOptic explaining how my face gets awfully bloated after large meals, causing the glasses to slide to the tip of my nose. Haven’t heard a response yet. But I guess it makes sense. I can’t have a keychain that’s too large or else the style aspect of the product fails. But what do I know? I’m sure the creator of this innovative product can overcome this one-inch barrier that my pea-sized brain fails to.</p>
