        <p>As of now, I’m not sure whether or not I want to pursue a creative or a professional website. If I pursue a professional website, then I’ll likely try to put my projects on it and keep it as simplistic as possible. If I pursue a creative website, then I’ll try to incorporate some sort of theme that would match with my interests. 

For a professional website, I believe keeping it as simple as possible is the best idea. I think I would try to limit the colors to black, white, or something simple that directs the attention to the content rather than the aesthetics of the page. I want a website that is simple to use and to navigate through. The menu would not have many options. It would likely just have an about me section, projects section, and a contact information section. Since I major in Information Science, I would like it if my website had a tech feel to it. I would keep the font simple such as Times New Roman, Georgia, or anything that would keep the page professional. At the bottom, I would include links to my contact info and Linkedin. I would imagine the page being geared towards potential employers in the future. However, I don’t have much experience yet so I wouldn’t have much to put on this website if it was to be a professional one. 

For a creative website, I would likely try to make it vibrant and include my hobbies and interests. I think I would still try to keep the page simple but with a more creative feel than the professional website. I wouldn’t limit the font I use and would likely try to use multiple depending on the section I am displaying. I would still want a website that is simple to use and easy to navigate through. I would include more options in the menu however. I would include an about me section, sports section, movies section, health section, and perhaps a couple more. I would also like to have a homepage that would include all of the posts I made and order them chronologically. I like the simplicity that cardamom and tea had on her page and would try to replicate something like that. Similarly to the professional website, I would include links to my contact info and social media at the bottom of the page. 

I’m still not sure which direction I would want to take.
