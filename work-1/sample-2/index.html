        <h2>Class Writing Assignment: Design Concept</h2>
        <!--<p>Work in Progress 1 begins here</p> -->
        <p>For my website, I was thinking about keeping the design simple and clean. I wouldn’t want to add any crazy colors. For the background color, I was thinking of keeping it white or some pastel color. I wouldn’t want the background color to distract the user from the contents on the page. As for the font, I wanted to keep it semi-informal. I don’t want the font to be Times New Roman or anything like that. I want the font to be inviting so maybe something like Arial, Quicksand, or Sriracha.</p>
        
        <p>I would want all of the pages to be structured the same way. Personally speaking, I would want the content of the pages to be in the same spot so it’s easier to navigate through. I want the alignment to be all the same. I would want the menu to be at the top of the page and be a drop-down one. I want to make use of the 80/20 rule by reducing the complexity of the website while maximizing the crucial 20% of the functions. </p>
        
        <p>Though it is subjective, I want an aesthetic page. I believe aesthetics and simplicity work hand-in-hand. By making the page as aesthetic as I can, it’ll appear easier to use.  I want the navigation menu to be a separate color from the rest of the page. I want that part to stand out</p>
        
        <p>I think I would want to include a headshot on the home screen so viewers would get an idea of who I am. In addition, I would add contact info at the footer of the page. I would also want to change the color of the headers. I would want my page to have multiple colors so it’d appear more vibrant instead of letting the simplicity make it bland.</p>
