        <h2>Written Reflection</h2>
        <p>To be honest, this second work-in-progress was very difficult to complete due to a variety of situations and circumstances. Due to the entire ongoing COVID-19 situation, I found it very difficult to get adjusted to online classes and back into the grind of day-to-day schoolwork. During spring break, I was actually in Mexico for a mission trip and had no service or access to my phone. So when I came back the Thursday night before our spring break was supposed to end, I was quite shocked at all the news and the progression of the virus. I had to figure out what my plans were moving forward in such a short amount of time. I honestly had a hard time believing what was happening and the severity of the disease. So with so many thoughts and news circulating in my mind, my schoolwork was not at the forefront of my mind. </p>
        
        <p>However, before the entire COVID-19 situation, I already had a difficult time with photoshop. Even to the time I write this reflection, I believe I lack an understanding of photoshop and all of its functions. The first difficulty I found with the photoshop unit was using the desktops in the lab. I don’t own a mac so I had no idea where I was saving everything and it would always take me a while to find the last thing I worked on. I also just didn’t know what any of the functions in photoshop did. I didn’t know how to incorporate it into my work. I didn’t know what layering even. I felt pretty lost most of the time. By the time I finished all of the assignments for this work-in-progress, I still didn’t feel like I had a solid grasp of photoshop. I definitely learned a lot since I first started, but photoshop didn’t feel like a weapon at my disposal. It didn’t feel like something I could use casually or bring into my everyday life.</p>
        
        <p>I think of all four photoshop assignments that I had to do, I found doing the storyboard the most enjoyable. I enjoyed redoing my Pecha Kucha and drawing the pictures that I used. It also progressed the smoothest out of all of them which was probably the reason why I actually enjoyed doing it. But I had a rough time doing the other three assignments. I lack creativity so I didn’t really know what to do with the pictures I chose and they all ended up being quite basic. I had a really difficult time coming up with ideas. That paired with my lack of photoshop knowledge turned out to be a disaster.</p>
        
        <p>In terms of my website, I wanted to change the font because my original font looked too basic and ugly. My website is overall really simplistic and that’s something I want to change with the remaining weeks I have. I still don’t know too much about CSS, but I already know it’s basically all trial and error. I haven’t changed any of the principle designs I used for the first work in progress submission. I still heavily emphasize alignment with everything being centered in the middle. I still want to emphasize the aesthetic-usability effect but am unsure of how to best make the page more objectively aesthetic. My page, as of now, is definitely extremely basic, but that’s something I do intend on changing drastically. I spent most of my photoshop experience googling how to do certain things and then end up being confused. There are so many functions with photoshop and it was difficult to pinpoint which ones to use. I found myself using the brush tool a lot, especially in the storyboard assignment. I drew my entire storyboard with the brush tool basically. I used a mishmash of tools for the remaining assignments. I found myself using the lasso tool a lot and using multiple layers to add certain pictures on top of one another. </p>
       
        <p>I just felt very rushed with this work-in-progress 2 assignment. I had to go home due to a family situation and left my laptop charger in my apartment in Pittsburgh. I couldn’t start my assignment until I got back in the late afternoon on Saturday. I also didn’t have access to any of my old photoshop files since I never submitted them on box(which I should’ve) because none of them were complete. I know this entire reflection sounds like me making excuses which it probably is. But I figured I should be transparent with the issues that arose as I was trying to complete this assignment. All in all, I hate photoshop.</p>
