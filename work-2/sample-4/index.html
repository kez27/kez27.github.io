        <p>I think I would like to make an app that compiles all of the ingredients that you have and outputs recipes for you to try. I know for myself this would be a useful app since Iâ€™m not that great at cooking. After grocery shopping, the user can input all of the ingredients they buy and also the ingredients they have left at home. In addition to storing the ingredients that you have, the app can keep track of expiration dates and prioritize recipes that involve foods that are about to go bad. This app is catered towards any age group. The goal is to be simplistic and user-friendly. The recipes can be categorized into different levels as well. The user can pick whatever difficulty of dish they want to try making. For younger and less-experienced people, the easier recipes could be given. For parents or people who want to try something new, the more complex recipes could be given. The name of this app/company can be Recipreach.</p>
